### Frontend Implementation Plan

The frontend will consist of a web application (built with Vite) and a desktop application (using Electron to wrap the web app). A shared UI component library will also be established.

**1. `frontend/web` - Web Application (Vite)**

*   **Technology Stack:**
    *   **Framework:** React (or user's preferred framework like Vue/Svelte).
    *   **Build Tool:** Vite.js for fast development and optimized builds.
    *   **Language:** TypeScript.
    *   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS or a CSS-in-JS solution (e.g., Styled Components) for consistent styling.
    *   **UI Library:** Mantine v8.
*   **Setup:**
    *   Initialize a new Vite project within `frontend/web`.
    *   Configure `tsconfig.json` for TypeScript.
    *   Set up routing (e.g., React Router DOM).
    *   Integrate state management (e.g., Zustand, Redux Toolkit, React Context) as needed.
    *   Define environment variables for API endpoints and other configurations.
*   **Development:**
    *   `npm run dev`: Start the Vite development server.
    *   `npm run build`: Build the production-ready web application.

**2. `frontend/desktop` - Desktop Application (Electron)**

*   **Technology Stack:**
    *   **Framework:** Electron.
    *   **Language:** TypeScript.
    *   **Packaging:** Electron Builder for cross-platform packaging.
*   **Setup:**
    *   Initialize a new Node.js project within `frontend/desktop`.
    *   Install Electron and Electron Builder.
    *   Create `main.ts` (Electron's main process) to handle window creation, app lifecycle, and IPC.
    *   Configure `preload.ts` for secure communication between the renderer and main processes.
    *   Configure Electron to load the *built* `frontend/web` application (e.g., `file://path/to/web/dist/index.html`).
*   **Features:**
    *   Basic window management (resize, minimize, close).
    *   Custom menu bar (if required).
    *   IPC channels for desktop-specific functionalities (e.g., file system access, native notifications).
*   **Development:**
    *   `npm run electron:dev`: Start Electron with the web development server running in parallel.
    *   `npm run electron:build`: Build the web app, then package the Electron application for various platforms.

**3. `frontend/ui` - Shared UI Component Library**

*   **Purpose:** To house reusable UI components, styles, and utility functions that can be shared between `frontend/web` and `frontend/desktop` (if applicable, or other future frontends).
*   **Technology Stack:**
    *   **Framework:** React (or compatible with the chosen web framework).
    *   **Language:** TypeScript.
    *   **Styling:** Consistent with `frontend/web` (e.g., Tailwind CSS, Styled Components).
    *   **Tooling:** Potentially Storybook for component documentation and isolated development.
*   **Setup:**
    *   Initialize a new Node.js/TypeScript project within `frontend/ui`.
    *   Configure it as a local package that can be consumed by `frontend/web` and `frontend/desktop` (e.g., using `npm link` or Yarn workspaces if the monorepo grows).
*   **Content:**
    *   Common buttons, input fields, modals, layouts.
    *   Design tokens (colors, typography, spacing).
    *   Utility hooks or functions.

**4. Monorepo Integration & Build Workflow**

*   **Root `package.json`:** Manage common scripts and dependencies, or use a monorepo tool like Lerna or Turborepo if the project scales.
*   **Build Script:** A top-level script (e.g., `npm run build:all`) that orchestrates:
    1.  Building `frontend/ui`.
    2.  Building `frontend/web`.
    3.  Building and packaging `frontend/desktop`.
