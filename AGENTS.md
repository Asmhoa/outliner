# Agent Workflow for API and Client Generation

This document outlines the workflow for managing the API and the auto-generated TypeScript client in this project.

## Makefile

The project includes a `Makefile` with several commands to streamline common development tasks.

-   `make test`: Runs the test suite.
-   `make run-backend`: Starts the development backend.
-   `make gen-api`: Regenerate the OpenAPI typespec used by the frontend based on the backend.
-   `make run-frontend`: Starts the development frontend.
-   `make clean`: Removes temporary files, such as Python cache files (`.pyc`), test caches, and log files.
-   `make format`: Format the codebase.

## Backend (Server)

The backend is a Python [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) application located in the `server/` directory.

### API Documentation and Specification

FastAPI automatically generates an OpenAPI 3.0 specification for the API.

-   **Swagger UI:** [http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs)
-   **ReDoc:** [http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc](http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc)
-   **OpenAPI Spec (JSON):** [http://127.0.0.1:8000/openapi.json](http://127.0.0.1:8000/openapi.json)

The server must be running to access these. Use `make dev` to start the frontend and server, or to run only the server:

```bash
cd server && uv run python -m outliner_api_server
```

### Running tests
`make test` will test all components. To test only the server:

```bash
cd server && uv run pytest
```

## Frontend (Web)

The frontend is a React+TypeScript application located in `frontend/web/`.

### Typed API Client Generation

The project uses [`openapi-ts`](https://github.com/hey-api/openapi-ts) to automatically generate a typed TypeScript client from the backend's OpenAPI specification.

-   **Generated Code Location:** `frontend/web/src/api-client/`
-   **Types:** `frontend/web/src/api-client/types.gen.ts`
-   **API Services:** `frontend/web/src/api-client/sdk.gen.ts`

### How to Update the API Client

To update the client after making changes to the FastAPI application:

1.  **Ensure the backend server is running.**
2.  **Run the generation script**

    ```bash
    cd frontend/web/ && npm run generate-api-client
    ```

This script executes the `openapi-ts` command, which fetches the latest `openapi.json` from the running server and regenerates the client code. This ensures the frontend's API client is always in sync with the backend API.

### Running Playwright Tests

The frontend includes Playwright tests for end-to-end testing. To run these tests:

1. Navigate to the frontend web directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend/web
   ```

2. Install Playwright browsers (needed for first run):
   ```bash
   npm install playwright/tests --with-deps
   ```

3. Run all Playwright tests:
   ```bash
   npx playwright test
   ```

4. To run tests in headed mode (to see the browser):
   ```bash
   npx playwright test --headed
   ```

5. To run tests for a specific browser:
   ```bash
   npx playwright test --project=chromium
   npx playwright test --project=firefox
   npx playwright test --project=webkit
   ```

6. To run a specific test file:
   ```bash
   npx playwright test tests/basic.spec.ts
   ```

7. To view the HTML test report after running tests:
   ```bash
   npx playwright show-report
   ```

The Playwright configuration is set up to:
- Run tests in parallel
- Use http://localhost:5173 as the base URL
- Automatically start the dev server with `npm run dev` before running tests
- Generate an HTML reporter
- Retry failed tests on CI environments

### Frontend Component Structure

-   `frontend/ui`: This directory is intended for shared UI components (e.g., React components) that can be used across different frontend applications.
-   `frontend/web`: The web application, which consumes shared components from `frontend/ui`.
-   `frontend/desktop`: The desktop application, which also consumes shared components from `frontend/ui`.
